# Motor_UltraSonic_MovementControl

Note: Unless you are planning on changing this code in any way, you will need the follwing components to use the code: arduino board, 2 motors, and 3 ultra sound sensor

This project is made to contorl a simple robot that uses arduino board, three ultra sound sensors, and two wheels motor small car.

what the code simply does is that it moves the towrds any object located by the sensor if the object is 10 cm away. If the two sensors on the side are detecting and object within the same distance, it goes backward.
